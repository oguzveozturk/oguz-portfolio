paragraph: "During my 4-month tenure at Improver Digital Tech, I started and completed this project. We were an 8-person team and worked swiftly to meet the client's requirements. This project allowed users to share their outfits, follow each other, and send DM's via socket. Unfortunately, the app was removed from the App Store two years after I left."
