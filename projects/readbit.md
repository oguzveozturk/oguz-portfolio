paragraph: "I spearheaded the ReadBit project in 2020, leveraging SwiftUI to stay ahead of the curve with modern iOS development practices. This early adoption allowed me to quickly become proficient with SwiftUI and Combine frameworks. Our team, consisting of 4-6 iOS developers, collaborated closely to build a robust subscription management system from the ground up. We also successfully integrated a seamless paywall experience, enhancing the app's monetization strategy."

### Challenges

The most challenging part of this project was adapting to declarative programming with SwiftUI. It required setting aside the reflexes and habits formed with UIKit and thinking differently. Another significant challenge was dealing with the limitations of the initial versions of SwiftUI. We couldn't progress much without StateObject and LazyVGrid, which forced us to drop iOS 13 support. The navigation structure was particularly difficult, and we regretted not handling navigation through UIKit. Despite these challenges, becoming an iOS developer proficient in SwiftUI over the past four years and staying up-to-date with innovations has been incredibly rewarding.
